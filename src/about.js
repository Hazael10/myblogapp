        <h1>My Story.</h1>
        <p>
          “Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony … then
          everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar,
          master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world
          needed him most, he vanished.”
        </p>
        <h2>My Experiences.</h2>
        <p>
          I do Web Development, Graphic Arts, Oil/Charcoal/Rust Painting and I
          am a Certified Digital Animator too!
        </p>
        <h3>My Motto</h3>
        <p>
          I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus When they say, "You
          ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?" But I got my head in the
          clouds like Zeus Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view
          B-, you talkin' to a rap god Girl, you talkin' to a monsta You could
          give your whole damn life to the music thing They gon' turn around
          like they don't love you
